// TODO: Define middleware here

// 1. logRoutes — logs the HTTP method, URL, and timestamp for every request, then calls next()

// 2. express.static() — generates middleware that serves files from the frontend/ folder
//    Use path.join(__dirname, '../frontend') to construct the absolute path

// TODO: Register middleware with app.use() before the controllers



// TODO: Define controllers here

// listQuotes — sends all quotes as JSON
//   If the request includes a ?topic= query string, send only quotes with a matching topic

// getQuote — sends a single quote whose id matches req.params.id
//   If no matching quote is found, respond with 404 and { error: 'No quote with id <id>' }



// TODO: Register endpoints here

// GET /api/quotes
// GET /api/quotes/:id



// TODO: Add a catch-all fallback that responds with 404 and { error: 'Not found: <url>' }
// Use app.use() and place it after all other routes
